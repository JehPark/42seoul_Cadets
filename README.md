This is my whole journeys of 42 school in Seoul, South Korea.

Task libft is to make the library of 42 functions. We need to recap the functions in the picines.

4/26/2021
I invited my two colleagues to review my codes and share the idea each other by github (bukim0329, leekh716)

4/28/2021
libft was tested by the test war machine from https://github.com/ska42?tab=repositories, I am really appreciate to him.
My test results is not that great but now I can fix my code and I need to install clang to use the tool.
New collaborator was added stripy1026, SW-H. New Tester was added https://github.com/jtoty/Libftest

4/29/2021
I got the newest version of libft.en.pdf. Therefore, I could do proper work for this problem.
Today I passed whole test from libft test. I decided to use another test tools to improve my codes.

4/30/2021
I finished two other testerss on libft. I couldn't figure out how to solve two error of ft_split.c about memory leak.
I consider that it occurs by OS differences or valgrind error or tester error. (I don't have an error on gcc fsanitizer)
